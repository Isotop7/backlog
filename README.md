# Backlog

This backlog is a list of some ideas I want to do someday:

## Software Development

- [ ] NTP Server (`Rust?`)
    - Queries external NTP servers
    - Saves time and handles timedrift
    - runs as systemd job
    - binds to NTP port and serves time and date within protocol standards
- [ ] LED resistance calculator (`Rust / Go`)
    - takes two values from vRef, voltage of LED or resistance of LED and calculates the missing value
- [ ] Simple chat client (`Rust / Go`)
    - server and client
    - anonymous login with creating a hash
    - rooms
    - shortlinks
    - IRC-like KISS protocol
- [ ] USB iterator (`Rust`)
    - iterates all connected USB devices and shows useful informations
- [ ] RSS feed collector (`Rust / Go`)
    - add RSS feeds and keywords
    - generates notification when keyword is found
- [ ] Syslog server (`Go`)
    - binds to part and can receive syslog messages
    - stores them into a database based on sender IP
    - WebUI to show logs
    - Follow mode for logs
    - Filtering
    - Searching

## 3D Printing

- [ ] Sony A7 M2 Thumb Grip
    - is attached to the hot shoe connector and improves the handling of the camera
